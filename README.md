# Ball-Bounce
A simple ball bounce program, with basic ball-on-ball collision simulation I made in grade 10.

It uses some basic vector math to do all the bounce simulations (which I had to teach myself over the summer before).

Things I learned:
- Vector Math
  + Vector Addition
  + Vector Dot Products
  + Vector Projection
- Handling Collision off of curved surfaces
